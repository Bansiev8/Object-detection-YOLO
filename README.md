# Object-detection-YOLO
This is a simple project for detecting everyday objects using YOLO method

The basic idea behind the code is that, first the data set, that is the weights are loaded and preprocessing is done.

Then the image is converted into a blob of black and white images and the weights are compared with it.

After detecting the object boxes are drawn to represent the outline of the object
